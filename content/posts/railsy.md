summary: "Get dispolsable emails right from your terminal!"

[Railsy](https://crates.io/crates/railsy) is a CLI tool made to make generating and using temporary emails as easy as possible. I drew inspiration from the [Mailsy](https://github.com/BalliAsghar/Mailsy) project, but that was only available on homebrew and npm. 

The code is [here](https://www.github.com/mmkaram/railsy). Viewing incoming messages/message previews works, but other features are coming.
